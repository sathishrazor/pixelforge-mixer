🎯 What It Does

PixelForge Mixer gives creators a simple interface to:

Import pixel art frames or draw directly in the app

Arrange frames for animated sequences

Preview your animations in real time

Export or reuse frames in other creative projects

All processing happens locally in your browser, so nothing is uploaded to a server — perfect for privacy and speed.

💡 Why It’s Useful

Pixel art is a staple in indie games, retro-style apps, and creative experiments. Tools like PixelForge Mixer make it easier to prototype and visualize pixel animations without heavy tooling or complex setups.

🚀 Built With Modern Web Tools

The app is built with static React, so it compiles down to simple HTML and assets that can be hosted anywhere — in this case, GitHub Pages. This makes deployment super cheap and efficient. Your build files are just an index.html and a folder of assets.

📌 Who It’s For

Pixel artists testing quick animations

Game developers prototyping sprite motion

Frontend devs exploring creative tooling

Anyone who loves simple, web-first, creative experiments
